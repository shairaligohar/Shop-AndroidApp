## Shortcomings/Improvements

- Code needs to be cleaned: 
  - Remove unused or automatically generated code
  - Use of string resources instead of hard coded strings
  - Revise public/private keys as part of security
- Commits' comments are meaningless and just show the progress, some better wordings could have used.
